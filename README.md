### DESIGN PHASE

define an economy by defining holonic market interactions through open source web apps

## motivations

- holonism
- open source economy
- cooperative economy
- web payments

### holonism

#### holons

a holon is something that is simultaneously a whole and a part.

rules:

- invariant properties
- structural configuration
- functional pattern

strategies:

- choose among permissible choices of environment

skills:

- functional hierarchies of sub-holons governed by sub-rules

##### individual holons

posesses a dominant monad. everything moves as one step.

##### social holons

does not posess a dominant monad. each sub holon moves independently but can achieve collective activity.

#### holarchies

a holon is a node in a holarchy.

- a holon looks up for what it needs to cooperate with and integrate with.
- a holon looks sideways for what it needs to compete with.
- a holon looks down for what it wants to command.
